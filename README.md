# Bank-Personal-Loan-Classification

Universal bank is a small but growing bank. The majority of customers are liability, or deposit only customers, and the bank is interested in converting more of them into asset, or borrowing, customers. The bank has had past success with marketing campaigns to convert the liability customers to personal loan customers. With that success, the bank is interested in being more targeted with its efforts to ensure marketing dollars are spent on those most likely to convert. The bank would like a model to help it predict which new customers are likely to become personal loan customers to aid in this targeting.

## Problem Statement

Can we predict which new customers are most likely to say yes to a personal loan?
